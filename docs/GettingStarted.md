# Getting Started

## Setting up and funding a wallet

If you don't have a wallet, you can create one using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or any other wallet of your choice.

To use our platform while on Testnet, you will need some testnet ETH.

<!-- To use our platform while on Unichain Sepolia Testnet, you need to add the network to your wallet using this guide: [Add Unichain Sepolia Testnet to MetaMask](https://docs.unichain.org/docs/getting-started/setting-up-a-wallet)

Now, you will need to get some testnet ETH to use our platform. You can get some from the [Unichain Sepolia Faucet](https://docs.unichain.org/docs/getting-started/get-funds-on-unichain) -->

Once you have your wallet set up and funded, you can proceed to create a profile [here](/profiles).
