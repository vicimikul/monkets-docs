# Getting Started

## Setting up and funding a wallet

If you don't have a wallet, you can create one using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or any other wallet of your choice.

To use our platform while on Testnet, you will need some testnet MON.


Once you have your wallet set up and funded, you can proceed to create a profile [here](/profiles).
