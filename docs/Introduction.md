# Introduction

Welcome to the newest trading terminal on Unichain.

## What is Lunipump?

Lunipump is a trading system that allows you to create tokens, deploy bonding curves and trade them before they are deployed to Uniswap. We aim at providing the best trading experience on Unichain and serve as a foundational layer for other DeFi protocols that will be built on top of our platform.

## Why Unichain?

Unichain is the newest blockchain that is being built on top of Ethereum. It is a high-performance, low-cost blockchain that is designed to be a foundation for the next generation of DeFi protocols. By being part of the Superchain ecosystem, Unichain directly taps into liquidity from multiple layer 2s from day one.

## How to use Lunipump?

Deploy your first token using our guide on how to [Create a Token](/docs/trading/create-token).

To learn more about the bonding curves check our [Bonding Curves](/docs/trading/bonding-curves) docs.
