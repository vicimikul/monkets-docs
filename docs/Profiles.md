# Profiles

## Create a profile

When joining the platform for the first time, you will need to create a profile. This profile will be used to track your trading activity and rewards. All you need to do is connect your wallet and pick a username and description, and in case you have been referred by another user, you will need to enter the referral code of the user who referred you.
