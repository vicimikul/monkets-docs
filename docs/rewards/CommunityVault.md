# Community Vault

## How it works

The community vault is a pool of ETH that is being used to reward the community for their contributions to the platform.

The funds are being collected from the fees associated with trading on the platform and from the deployment fees.

## Points System

We want to reward everyone for their platform activity, therefore, users will accumulate points for their activity, which will be used to determine their rewards. The main actions to earn points are:

- Being the creator of a token that has been deployed to Uniswap, which helps you climb the creator leaderboard
- Generating trading volume, which helps you climb the volume leaderboard
- Deploy your best trading strategies and climb the PnL leaderboard

## Distributing rewards

Is it still yet to be determined how the points will be distributed and what the points/ETH ratio will be.
