# Leaderboards

We implemented couple of leaderboards to help people compete and display their achievements among the community. We are considering an epoch mechanism where the leaderboard will be reset every month, and at the end of every epoch, the top users will be rewarded using the [Community Vault](/docs/rewards/community-vault).

## Creator Leaderboard

The creator leaderboard is a leaderboard that displays the top creators of tokens on the platform. This tracks both the number of deployed tokens and how many of these tokens have been deployed to Uniswap.

## PnL Leaderboard

The PnL leaderboard is a leaderboard that displays the top traders on the platform based on their PnL. This tracks the PnL of all traders on the platform and displays the top traders.
