# Referrals

## Generating Invite Codes

### Closed Release

Initially, only a selected group will be chosen to become ambassadors. This will allow them to generate refferal codes, which can be used to invite their community to the platform.

### Open Release

In the near future, this functionality will be opened up to the public, allowing anyone to generate referral codes and invite their friends.

## Benefits 

Whenever someone that joined using your referral code receives points, you also receive a share of that. On top of that, you will be able to earn more points by climbing the referral leaderboard, but also having your referrals a the top of any of our leaderboards.
